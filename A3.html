<p>Mom: Well make sure you don't be mean to them or they won't be your friends anymore </p>

<p>You: OK</p>

<p>You hear the bus coming out to your stop and said goodbye to your parents.</p>

<p>You saw the bus and ran towards it, but it was to far and you miss it. 
    Luckily you saw a forest short cut that leads towards your school.</p>

<p>And you think you should grab your bike or you just run on foot. </p>

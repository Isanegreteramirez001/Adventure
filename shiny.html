<p>~You decided to cross the creek and
    now your pants are soaked and your
    shoes.~</p>

<p>~You saw the shiny thing behind a 
    sprout of grasses and see it that it is 
    unfamiliar.~</p>

<p>The symbol that is on the shiny thing is a half of a pentagram on your left while other half is a cross you put it in your pocket and run back to school.</p>

<p>You are late, you got soaked from the creek, you changed from the pants that the office gave you , and got ready for Math class. </p>

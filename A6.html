<p>~You decided to Skip lunch or eaten your lunch~</p>

<p>~So then you 
    went to the library.~</p>

<p>~You are picking out your favorite books until suddenly your pant's light up~
</p>
    <p>You: "What the heck"</p>
<p>~You went to the most private of the library and you get out of the shiny thing that was making a odd glow and you flipped it around to see a button.~ ~You hesitantly pressed it and something shown in front of your face which look like a status screen form a game~</p>

<p>You: "What is going on."</p>

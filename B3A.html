<p>~You turn back and won't go into the cave until you have been prepared. ~</p>

<p>~You went back home and waited until it was night and the time your parents go to sleep.~</p>

<p>~You went out in the dark when it is 11:00 pm.~</p>

<p>~You went back to the cave with a flashlight in your hand while the other is the shiny thing.~</p>

<p>~You have walked into the cave until you have found a room in the end.</p>

<p>~It was a circular room with some light, But what was strange was there was a pedastal in the middle.~</p>

<p>~You walked a little closer and see there is something missing in the pedalstal.~</p>

<p>~You checked on your shiny thing and saw that it has the same shape as the shiny you have in your possession.~</p>

<p>~The shiny thing has went up to the pedalstal by itself and has fitted inside of it. </p>

<p>~The pedestal made a clicking sound where it been split in too and the shiny has went back to your hand.~</p>

    Chapter 1<br>
The main character name is Cleo Jayden and his story starts in the season of spring when he wake up to get ready for school and while he miss his bus he took an short cut to the forests to get to school on time, but something caught his eye something glowing on the other side of the creek and crossed this creek and found something interesting and put it in his pocket.<br>
He was late to Math class.<br>
Lunch was after the math lessons where he found someone who was sitting alone on a table and he went to ask if he could sit by her.<br>
She lets Cleo sit by her and he and her start talking to one another.<br>
Cleo and her have so much in common.<br>
Cleo told her his name is Cleo Jayden then he asked for her name, She said that her name is Fabiana Clare then the bell rings for the end of lunch both of them said their goodbyes.<br>
In English class Cleo's teacher Mr.Seija has news for the class that there is gonna be a new student in class today.<br>
The new student is none other than Fabiana Clare, the girl Cleo talks to at lunch.<br>
She asked the teacher if Cleo could show her around the campus and he did so while being stared at and embarrassed.<br>
After talking to her about the campus and its facilities something has glowed in Cleo's pocket and it was the thing he had picked up earlier in the creek.<br>
Cleo and Fabiana have reacted to the light and see a piece of the text that is on a sometype of screen like in a game.<br>
Chapter 2<br>
Fabiana and Cleo were shocked by what they witnessed as both saw stats right in their eyes.<br>
Fabiana looked closer and read aloud the words on the Screen “Quest: Save the war between Angles and the Demons The hero Cleo Jayden”.<br>
Fabiana is looking at Cleo like you're the hero and was depressed like why she is not a hero since this one of the anime that she saw has this kind of setup.<br>
Then a screen pops up where it says There is an ally named Fabiana Clare who wants to be a hero do you accept.<br>
Cleo tells Fabiana that he has good news for her.<br>
She checked the screen and told Cleo to press yes.<br>
Cleo did, suddenly the stats window has another named tag under Cleo name, Fabiana's name that is.<br>
Fabiana jumped up and down and was excited to be a hero too.<br>
She asked Cleo where he found it and Cleo said in the forest trail where the creak is.<br>
She tells him that Cleo and her are gonna meet at that same creek after school, but Cleo was worried and said okay.<br>
After School: Cleo and Fabiana went to the Creek where Cleo had found the object.<br> 
Then Cleo pulled the object, then it started to glow a small glow.<br>
A Guiding light has gone through the object to the forests Fabiana told Cleo that they need to follow it.<br>
Fabiana goes straight to the creek then studies it, while Cleo is behind her.<br>
Fabiana was worried about getting her clothes wet.<br>
So, Cleo picked her up and steadily walk across the lake while Fabiana was being quiet and kinda hiding her face with her hands.<br> 
Cleo went to the other side of the creek and put Fabiana down, Fabiana still quiet.<br>
Cleo then remembered what he just did.<br>
“Sorry for what I just did," Cleo told to Fabiana.<br>
There was an awkrawrd silence in the air.<br>
"Let's keep on going," Fabiana nods and followed Cleo.<br>
(Minutes pass) Finally they stopped at an entrance of some sort.<br>
Cleo said we should since it's dark in there, but Fabiana disagrees and that we should still continue.<br>
Cleo told her that we don't have any light.<br>
Fabiana reached for her pocket and took out a phone and she put it on flashlight mode.<br>
Well isn't this better she told Cleo, Cleo said it is fine but we should still be careful.<br>
They walked in the cave for seem like for hours until finally they saw a clearing.<br>
In the clearing it was a bright room filled with shelves of books while the strange part there is a pedestal in the middle.<br>
Cleo said, "What is that?".<br>
Both of the friends walk to the pedestal and see something missing on top of it.<br>
The object floated in the air and landed up top of the missing piece and suddenly the room shook.<br>
The pedestal started opening up Cleo rushed to grab the object and succeeded.<br>
What has come out of the pedestal seems like a winged being statue replaced by the pedestal then it started to shatter.<br>
The Winged being is actually an angel with a suit of armor, Cleo and Fabiana took a step back and went in awe of seeing an angel.<br>
The angel started talking to itself and stretching.<br>
The Angel noticed Cleo and Fabisna and asked "Who are you two."<br>
Chapter 3<br>
The Angel took steps forward towards them and said again "Who are you two."<br>
"My name is Cleo Jayden and this young girl is Fabiana Clare," Cleo answered the mysterious angel.<br>
The angel looked closer and said "You aren't lying."<br>
The mysterious angel stopped and looked at what Cleo has.<br>
The Angel said “Where did you get that?”<br>
Cleo told the angel that he had found it by the creek in the small grasses.<br>
Cleo asked him “what is it?”<br>
The angel told them he would explain, but he told them that we need to move somewhere else. The angel put his hands in the air and said a magic prayer.<br>
The room started to shift into a different room which looks like a coffee table.<br>
He told the friends to sit down and have some refreshments.<br>
(minutes passed) Cleo asked the angel who you are.<br>
The angel answered that his name is Balance.<br>
Cleo and Fabiana have turned their hand to the side and said balanced with a confused expression.<br>
The angel said, "Yes, that is my name and title”.<br>
Balance has said that he is the angel of balance where he is the protector of Heaven and Heck.<br>
And to answer your other questions you guys are thinking that what you are holding is my weapon which has been passed down for a millennia since I've been asleep and turned to stone.<br>
This object has seemed to choose you and been passed down to you. “What is it called and what does it do?” Cleo asked.<br>
Balance has answered It is called the Pentacross and what it does is to let you become a demon, angel, and/or become both.<br>
Cleo said, "What do you mean?" Fabiana asked why that screen showed up to our faces blocking Cleo's question.<br>
Balanced answer that screen you guys have seen is your both of yours that is one of the mechanisms that the PentaCross does.<br>
Cleo asked again “What do you mean it will turn you into an Angel, Demon, and/or both.”<br>
Balanced heard Cleo question and answered “They are forms of what the PentaCross that gives you the ability to turn into a angel that is meant for defense and support, while the demon form is meant for speed and power and lastly the Balance form that lets you combine the two forms which is the Pentacross trump card.”<br>
And now you have the responsibility to use this power for the only thing, that is to stop the war between demons and angels and the enemy is the one who started this war.<br>
Balance asked “Cleo, do you accept?”<br>
“No.”<br>
Chapter 4<br>
"What did you just say Cleo?" Fabiana aked Cleo.<br> 
“I said No, I don't want to do this since I'm no hero.” Cleo answered.<br>
Balance went down and said to Cleo "Sorry, Kid but the PentaCross has picked you for this mission."<br>
Cleo put the Pentagram back to his pocket and left for the door and went out of the cave.<br>
“Fabiana, you should follow him,” Balanced asked Fabiana.<br>
Fabiana left for the door.<br>
Both Cleo and Fabiana went out of the cave.<br>
“What is your deal!?” Fabiana asked angrily at Cleo.<br>
Cleo answered, “It is too much to process right now and I want to think about it.”<br>
Fabiana “What is to think about you can become a hero, just right there why you have to say no?”<br>
“Because I am no hero, I don't want that kind of responsibility,” Cleo answered looking down “And I will mess up before it will begin.”<br>
Fabiana smacked him in the head.<br>
Cleo yelled “Hey, what is that for!?”<br> 
Fabiana said “For being an idiot.”<br>
Cleo keeped his voice low, and said “That is what I am, I'm an idiot” tears started flowing between them.<br>
Cleo walked away and started going back home.<br>
Fabiana said under her breath “You are an idiot.<br>
Cleo is back at home and goes to his room and lies down and keeps repeating the words of what Fabiana said: “You are an idiot.”<br>
Cleo thought really hard.<br>
The door opens and his Dad has gone in and asked Cleo what is wrong.<br>
Cleo stayed silent.<br>
His dad moved closer and told Cleo he could tell him anything.<br>
Cleo thought about it.<br>
Cleo got up and told his dad of what happened, not all but some parts.<br>
After listening, his dad gave Cleo some advice, but first it was a song.<br>
A song he heard when he was little it goes like this, “Someday, Someday it will get better you'll make through the stormy weather all you gonna do is give yourself some time, Someday, Someday it may take a little longer maybe tomorrow, maybe next summer all you gonna do is let yourself cry” He sung to Cleo.<br>
The song went into Cleo's head, his dad's face towards him, and said go tomorrow and apologize to your friend.<br>
She may forgive you or not but remember it will get better.<br>
Cleo said to his dad I will.<br>
(Next morning in school) Cleo was searching the Campus for Fabiana, but she was nowhere to be found and he thought of where she might run off The Creek.<br>
Cleo runs all the way to the Creek and finds Fabiana, but something doesn't look right.<br>
Cleo looks closer and there is someone attacking her, it is some kind of monster.<br>
Cleo runs to the monster and gets in front of it.<br>
“Are you okay?” Cleo asked Fabiana.<br>
“Yeah, kinda,” Fabiana answered.<br>
Chapter 5<br>
Cleo looks at the creature and sees that the monster has stats like in a game you saw that is level 5, HP 20 , ATK 3, DEF 0, Ability: None.<br>
Cleo pull out the PentaCross and check on your stats Level 3, HP 10, ATK 1, DEF 1, Ability: None Yet.<br>
“How am I gonna beat this beast?” Cleo thought, then he remembered what Balance said That this Item lets you turn into a Demon, Angel, or/and a Demon/Angel.<br>
But Cleo doesn't know how it works.<br>
Cleo checked the PentaCross stats, but the monster was lunging towards Cleo but he dodged while still reading the stats on the PentaCross and started running and dodging.<br>
Cleo went to the part to use it that he needs to have a Desire or/and have Faith.<br>
Cleo got frustrated that he looked up and saw Fabiana hiding behind a tree, and grabbed a stick and hit the monster that did 1 damage to it.<br>
The Monster felt it and saw Fabiana.<br>
Fabiana ran away but tripped and fell.<br>
The monster uses its attack on Fabiana.<br>
Cleo has run towards Fabiana and have felt that it is too late.<br>
"Please, please let me make it, please worked Pentacross, I want ot save her."<br>
A bright glow surrounded the area.<br>
When the light disappeared Cleo opened his eyes and saw that he had turned into an angel and looked up to the beast in front of him where it was paralyzed.<br>
He turned his back quickly and saw Fabiana still sitting with some kind of shield protecting her.<br>
Cleo checked his stats again and saw your stats have increased.<br>
Level 3, HP 50, ATK 10, DEF 20, Ability: Angel Barrier- This ability lets you to Protect your ally or yourself and physical attacks can't get through you can only have one barrier at a time. Barrier Durability: 1 minute, Cooldown: 30 minutes.<br>
Cleo went straight back to Fabiana and again he went in front of the monster and he saw in his profile he has a Item named Light Claymore he pressed use and a Claymore has went into his two hands it's ability that it deals double for ones that has a dark heart but ones with a good heart it deals 50% less damage.<br>
Cleo checked the Claymore and saw it deals 10 damage, but now it deals 20 damage since the monster has a dark heart.<br>
Cleo pulled back his Sword and took a swing at the monster and killed it in one hit.<br>
Cleo and Fabiana Celebrated and then he got leveled up and Fabiana now both of them are level 4 and their stats have changed.<br>
Another bright flash has gone off the PentaCross that on his chest and disappeared back to its original form.<br>
Cleo turned around and pulled out and said “Do you need a lift” towards Fabiana.<br>
Fabiana was hesitant then smacked Cleo's hand and got herself up.<br>
“Wha-”, but Fabiana cut him off and said “I'm still mad at you for leaving.”<br>
Cleo went into guilt then he went to his knees and went into a bowing stance.<br>
“I'm sorry for what I have done, please forgive me for being such an idiot, no a big stupid idiot."<br>
It was silent for a moment.<br>
Fabiana laughed.<br>
“Alright, I forgive you.”<br>
Cleo looked and saw Fabiana with her hand out.<br>
“Now you're the one who needs a lift" Cleo grabbed her hand and got back up standing. Fabiana started teasing Cleo for making such a funny apologizing display.<br>
Both of the friends went back to school and got in trouble but made a made up lie to where Cleo was gone Fabiana and he tried to find her.<br>
They have not been punished but they got a warning.<br>
(After School) They went into the cave and found Balance making himself some food.<br>
Cleo and Fabiana have sat down on the table and have asked for Balance attention.<br>
Balance looked at them and smiled.<br>
“I guess you guys are in a situation and have questions,” Balance said.<br>
Both Fabiana and Cleo have told Balance of what happened.<br>
“You turn into your angel form nice job, you can only bring it out if you have faith as you see in the stats window on it,” Balanced have said gleefully.<br>
Balanced took a bite and drank his tea.<br>
Balance finally said that he needs to train Cleo and Fabiana on their quest to stop the war between the demon and angels.<br>
Cleo and Fabiana said at the same time “Training!”.<br>
Cleo and Fabiana were excited that there was a thought that crossed Cleo's mind.<br>
He asked what started the war between the angels and the demons.<br>
Balanced look down and sigh.<br>
Balanced look at Fabiana and finally said Cleo it is simple have you read the revelation.<br>
Cleo looked hesitant then said not really but I did see it in videos and movies.<br>
Balanced said That the war is like that except that the war that one demon has started troubled in Heck by going into you guys home and starting eating, torturing, anything horrible you can think of, that is what a demon will do to you.<br>
And those same demons started going here and the angels were trying to stop them before they increased in numbers.<br>
As for me I have been stuck in that stone could't do a thing so I sent my Penatcross to find a worthy hero who can take up to the challenge and it seems it has chosen you Cleo.<br>
As for you Fabiana you are also a hero because not the Pentacross chose you but Cleo instead.<br>
Fabiana looked at Cleo and asked “Why did you choose me?” Cleo answered back saying “Because you want to be one.” Fabiana hugged Cleo and said “thank you.”<br>
Cleo is flustered by her kindness then snapped out of it and asked Balance a question.<br>
“How am I gonna stop the war?”<br>
Balanced answered “By using your Pentacross to seal the demons back into heck.”<br>
Fabiana said to Cleo “That sounds simple enough.”<br>
Balanced argued back “It is not since you have to actually go to Heaven and Heck to seal the demons.”<br>
Cleo slapped his head with his hand “Just Great” Cleo said. <br>
“Then How are we gonna go to Heaven and Heck to the sealing?”<br>
 Balanced laughed, “Well duh, you have the Pentacross remember, you can turn into an angel and a demon,” Balanced said.<br>
“Wait, I can actually go to both of those places,” Cleo asked.<br>
 Balanced said back “You can until you've experienced enough to actually go to Heaven or Heck.”<br>
“Now I will train you to get hold of this power and stop the war between the Demons and Angels Cleo, Do you accept?”<br>
Cleo smiled at Fabiana and said this time “I'm ready,” Cleo said.<br>

“We have been gaining level for this month, but as for me I still couldn't turn into my Demon form for the past month, only my Angel form.<br> 
I wonder how much longer I have until the Demon has finally come to earth. End of Cleos log.”<br>
Cleo walks inside the cave and sees if Balance is there and he is just sitting down drinking tea.<br>
Balance “What is it Cleo?”<br>
“I want to ask you how I can turn into a demon,” Cleo Answered.<br>
Balanced said “Becoming a demon is easy is where you must...”<br>
Cleo got confused about what he was about to say “...nevermind you will figure it out sooner or later.”<br>
“We don't have later!” Cleo shouted.<br>
“I don't know how long until the demons come and I have turned into a demon to do the seals that are in Heck and Heaven”.<br>
Balanced, put his head back and sigh.<br>
“We have plenty of time, but you should turn into your demon SOON if a strong demon has escaped or a Fallen angel has gone rampaged.<br>
Cleo went to the exit and gathered his thoughts of what Balanced was about to say.<br>
Until a voice has gotten his attention.<br>
“So what did you say to Balanced Cleo?”<br>
Cleo Looked at Fabiana to see how he and she had changed for the past month.<br>
“I ask him how I changed into my Demon form” Cleo answered.<br>
“He was about to say something until he stopped mid-sentence, then he told me It should be easy to turn into my demon form but it is harder than I thought.”<br>
Fabiana put her hand on her chin and thought about something and smiled.<br>
“We should have a break after all the time we did for training, so where do you wanna go?” Fabiana said.<br>
“I think we shouldn't, but since you offered maybe playing a game with each other.” Cleo answered.<br>
“That is not a bad thought, but I got a better idea, what about dinner and a movie?” Fabiana answered back.<br> 
Cleo blushed and looked back at Fabiana and mumbled “Yea-ah thha-t sounds goo-od.”<br>
“I wil-ll haa-ve to ask my par-ents.”<br>
Fabiana looked excited and said “Great , I will meet you at the movies at 6 okay.” Cleo answered “Okay” and thought “I would be there early.<br>
(At Home) “Alright I will be off” Cleo said back to his family.<br>
His Dad called back and said “Stay safe and don't get hit by a car.” Mom waited at the door and opened it and took a picture of Cleo and hugged him.<br>
Cleo got embarrassed but he didn't really care and he was off to the movie while his mother looked at him to see he's growing.<br>
(At the Theatherters) Cleo got there 30 min early and waited until it was only 10 min and Fabiana came along looking pretty.<br>
“Aawww you've beat me to it,” Fabiana said.<br>
“What do you mean?” Cleo answer.<br>
 “You know exactly what I mean,” Fabiana argued.<br>
 “There are scenes where the guy gets here early and says That I just got here and I was about to do the same thing to you, that was unfair of you,” Fabiana telled Cleo.<br>
“I didn't say it yet, but I will say, are you ready to watch a movie?” Cleo told Fabiana.<br>
“Gladly” Fabiana answered back.<br>
(After the movie) “That was so funny” Fabiana laughed.<br>
“Yeah I thought it was an Adventure movie but with Hack White in it they just made it funny.” Cleo Laughs with her.<br>
“So where are we going now?” Cleo asked Fabiana.<br>
Fabiana answered “We are going to Dinner, but where do you want to go?”<br>
Cleo thinks.<br>
Cleo answered “I'm not sure I don't know any good restaurants except for NickDollars.”<br>
Fabiana answered back “Sorry but no, we are not going into fast food restaurants, what about Penny's.”<br>
“Isn't that a fast food restaurant too?” Cleo argued back.<br>
“It is not a fast food restaurant, it's just a restaurant we Will go to,” Fabiana tells Cleo.<br>
“Fine, you're the boss,” Cleo answered. “Exactly,” Fabiana said while smiling at Cleo. And that is when Cleo has gotten awestruck by her smile.<br>
(At the Restaurant) The waiter came to the table where Cleo and Fabiana are sitting down and the waiter asked them if they could order anything.<br>
“I want to have a Sirloin Steak and a soft drink,” Fabiana told the waiter. “That's a wonderful choice young lady.<br>
Now you kind sir, what would you like to order?”<br>
The waiter looked at Cleo.<br>
“I want to have the same thing that she's having,” Cleo answered to the waiter.<br>
“Okay, will that be all?” The waiter asked.<br>
Both Cleo and Fabiana nod their heads.<br>
(30 min later) The waiter came and presented Cleo and Fabiana food on the table and said “Enjoy sir and lady.<br>
Both Cleo and Fabiana have started eating.<br>

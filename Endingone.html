<p>~You Ignored the object and keep 
    running towards your school.~</p>

<p>~You made it to school and the bell rung
    Now you are sitting in your desk and 
    now you here a large boom coming 
    out of the forests.~</p>

<p>~In the distance you see a ugly looking guy that is holding flames on his bare  hand. His clothing is something black and red armor and a symbol in the 
    center is a full pentagram were he has wings and a sharp tail which are demon like.~</p>

<p>~You saw the bus and ran towards it, but it was to far and you miss it. 
    Luckily you saw a forest short cut that leads towards your school.~</p>

<p>~And shouted something while the 
    students started screaming and
     running out of the classroom.~</p>
   
<p>~And a huge enormous fireball where 
    it hurled towards you and died.~</p>

    <p><strong>GAME OVER</strong></p>

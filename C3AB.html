<p>Balance: "Before I was turn to stone there was a war between Demons and Angels again that is very often.<br>
The War has happen when a Demon is trying to make it's way to the overworld or youcan say your world<br> 
Then later more demons will try to come out to the your world in which you may know as the revalation. 
So to banish the Demons from entering your world God has created two seals.
The seals are sperate from each other where one is in Heck and the other is in Heaven.
God has entrusted me to have the power to break or repair the seals.
When the War was over, God have gave me a task to turn myself to stone and to put myself in a cave and wait there for someone
and that someone is You Cleo."

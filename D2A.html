<p>You/Cleo: *Why doI have to be the hero?*</p>

<p>~You look at the water and see your reflection.~</p>

<p>~Something hit at your head~</p>

<p>You/Cleo: "Ow!"</p>

<p>~You turn your head and see Fabiana with some rocks in her hand.~</p>

<p>You/Cleo: "Why are you hitting me with rocks."</p>

<p>Fabiana: "For being a idiot."<br> "Why did you say no this could be your chance to become a hero."</p>

<p>You/Cleo: "It is too much to process right now and I want to think about."</p>

<p>Fabiana: “What is to think about you can become a hero, just right there. Why you have to say no?”</p>

<p>You/Cleo: “Because I am no hero, I don't want that kind of responsibility,” <br>
    “And I will mess up before it will begin.” </p>

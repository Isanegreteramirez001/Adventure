<p>~You didn't tell Fabiana and kept quiet and close it.~</p>

<p>Fabiana: "Where did you find it Cleo?"<br>
    You/Cleo: "I found it by a creek settling in behind in some grass."</p>
    
    <p>Fabiana: "We are gonna meet at that creek after school ok."</p>
    
    <p>(After school)~You and Fabiana have joined to the creek after school.~</p>
    
    <p>~You show Fabiana where you found the shiny thing.~</p>
    
    <p>You pulled out the shiny thing out of your pockets, then it has started admitted a samll glow of a guiding path of light.~</p>

<p>~You and Fabiana have went in awe of the light tha has shined from it~</p>

<p>Fabiana: "Come on Cleo, we should follow it."</p>

<p>You/Cleo: "Okay."</p>

    <p>~Fabiana goes straight to the creek then studies it, while Cleo is behind her.</p>

<p>~Fabiana was worried about getting her clothes wet.</p>

<p>You have picked her up and steadily walk across the lake while Fabiana was being quiet and kinda hiding her face with her hands.</p>

<p>You went to the other side of the creek and put Fabiana down, Fabiana still quiet.

<p>You just then remembered what you did.</p>

<p>You/Cleo: â€œSorry for what I just did."</p>

<p>~Fabiana still hiding her face.</p>

<p>~There was an awkrawrd silence in the air.~</p>

<p>You/Cleo: "Let's keep follow that light." </p>

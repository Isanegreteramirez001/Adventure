<p>Chapter 3</p>
<p>~You have took a step back and see what is gonna happen.~</p>

<p>~What came out of the pedestal was a statue of a male angel.~</p>

<p>~You gotten a little closer to get a better look.~</p>

<p>~Suddenly the statue started to crack.~</p>

<p>~You raised your flashlight at is, but it wouldn't turn on.~</p>

<p>You/Cleo: "Dang, Why it went out!?"</p>

<p>~The statue is still cracking, then the cracking stopped.</p>

<p>~You looked forward and to see a shining light of an angel.~</p>

<p>~You have went to your knees and bow down.~</p>

<p>~Then the angel has asked you a question~ "Who are you."</p>

<p>~You got up and speak your name.~</p>

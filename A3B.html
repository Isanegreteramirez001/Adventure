<p>Mom: "You need to make some friends or you'll be lonely" </p>

<p>You: "But, I do my best on my own Mom." </p>

<p>Mom: "You think so, but remember nobody could ever do anything on their own, So give a a lot of thought."</p>

<p> ~You thought for awhile~
 
    You: "I will try." </p>

<p>~You hear the bus coming out to your stop and said goodbye to your parents.~</p>

<p>~You saw the bus and ran towards it, but it was to far and you miss it. Luckily you saw a forest short cut that leads towards your school.~</p>

<p>~And you thought you should grab your bike or you just run on foot.~ </p>

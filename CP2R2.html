<p>~Fabiana and you were shocked by what they witnessed as both saw stats right in their eyes.~</p>

<p>~Fabiana looked closer and read aloud the words on the Screen.~ </p>

<p>Fabiana: <strong>“Quest: Save the war between Angels and the Demons, The Hero Cleo Jayden”.</strong></p>
   
<p>~Fabiana is looking at you like you're the hero and is depressed~</p>    

<p>Fabiana: *Why i'm not the hero too.*
*This is one of my favorite scenes in Anime where the main character dicovers that he/she is a hero.*</p>
